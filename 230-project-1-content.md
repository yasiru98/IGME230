### Player learning

+ The player will have to sucessfully collect and use power ups in order tobeat the game. This will be hard as power ups will appear randomly and the player will have to collect them without getting attacked by the enemies.
+ Green power ups will restore health. Red ones will give more firepower. The player will have to collect almost all of these to stand a chance at winning in the later stages.
+ Enemies will be more aggressive towards latter stages so the powerups will also change, such as blue power ups that shield the jet for a specific amount of time. The red powerups will also give even more firepower.
